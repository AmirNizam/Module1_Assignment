<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Square-logo-black.jpeg" width="350" height="250"/>Square Inc. was incorporated on **February 4, 2009**. It was founded by **Jack Dorsey** and **Jim McKelvey** in San Francisco, California. Since its inception, Square has grown into a prominent financial services company, offering a range of products and services for businesses and individuals alike

The idea for Square originated from a simple problem encountered by one of its co-founders, Jim McKelvey. McKelvey, who was a glassblower by trade, lost a sale for one of his artworks because he couldn't accept credit card payments. This incident occurred in 2009 when McKelvey was unable to sell a piece of his glass artwork to a customer who wanted to pay by credit card. This frustration led McKelvey to collaborate with his friend, Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, to find a solution.

Together, Dorsey and McKelvey developed the concept for Square: a small, square-shaped device that could be plugged into a smartphone or tablet and used to accept credit card payments. The device, which later became known as the Square Reader, allowed small businesses and individuals to accept card payments without the need for expensive point-of-sale systems or merchant accounts.

The idea behind Square was to democratize access to payment processing for small businesses and individuals who previously may have been unable to accept card payments due to the cost and complexity of traditional payment processing systems. By leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets, Square aimed to make it easy and affordable for anyone to accept payments anytime, anywhere.

This simple idea sparked the founding of Square, Inc. in 2009, and the company quickly gained traction, revolutionizing the way payments are accepted and processed in the modern digital economy.

Square has received funding through various rounds of venture capital financing, as well as through its initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. Here's a brief overview of Square's funding history:

1. **Early Funding Rounds**: In its early stages, Square raised funding from prominent venture capital firms and individual investors. Some of its notable early investors included Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Kleiner Perkins.
1. **Series A, B, C Rounds**: Square raised several rounds of funding, known as Series A, B, and C rounds, during its growth phase. These rounds brought in significant investment to support the company's expansion and development of new products and services.
1. **IPO**: In November 2015, Square went public with its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The IPO raised approximately $243 million and valued the company at around $2.9 billion.
1. **Subsequent Offerings and Financing**: Following its IPO, Square continued to raise additional capital through secondary offerings of its stock and other financing activities. These funds have been used to fuel the company's continued growth, product development, and expansion into new markets.

As for the total amount of funding Square has received, it's important to note that this information can change over time due to additional funding rounds, secondary offerings, and other financing activities. As of my last update in January 2022, Square had raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, including both private investment and funds raised through its IPO and subsequent offerings. For the most current and detailed information on Square's funding history, you can refer to financial databases, news sources, or Square's official filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Square's solution addressed several key pain points:

1. **Cost**: Traditional payment processing solutions often involved high setup fees, monthly service charges, and transaction fees. Square offered a transparent pricing model with no monthly fees and competitive transaction rates, making it more affordable for small businesses and individuals to accept card payments.
1. **Complexity**: Setting up a merchant account and acquiring the necessary hardware for card payments could be complex and time-consuming. Square simplified the process by providing an all-in-one solution that included the card reader and easy-to-use mobile apps for payment processing, inventory management, and reporting.
1. **Accessibility**: Many small businesses, artisans, and individuals, such as farmers' market vendors or freelance professionals, lacked access to traditional payment processing solutions. Square's portable card reader and mobile apps made it possible for these businesses and individuals to accept card payments anywhere, whether at a retail store, a pop-up event, or on the go.


Square's intended customers primarily include small businesses, independent contractors, freelancers, artisans, and individuals who need simple and accessible payment processing solutions.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), as of 2020, there were over 31 million small businesses in the United States, accounting for 99.9% of all businesses in the country. These businesses span a wide range of industries and sectors, contributing to various segments of the economy.

Similarly, in other countries around the world, small businesses and independent contractors make up a substantial portion of the business landscape. As the global economy continues to evolve, with increasing digitization and a growing emphasis on entrepreneurship, the market for Square's products and services among small businesses and individuals is likely to remain significant and continue to grow.


Square has leveraged several factors to establish a competitive edge in the financial services and payment processing industry. Here are some key aspects of Square's unfair advantage:

1. **Simplicity and Accessibility**: Square's products and services are designed to be incredibly simple and accessible, catering to the needs of small businesses and individuals who may lack technical expertise or resources. The Square Reader, for example, is easy to use and can be set up quickly with just a smartphone or tablet. This simplicity has made Square a popular choice among small merchants, artisans, and independent contractors who value ease of use and convenience.
1. **Innovative Technology**: Square has demonstrated a commitment to innovation, continuously developing new products and features to meet the evolving needs of its customers. From contactless payment options to integrations with digital wallets and cryptocurrency, Square has embraced emerging technologies to enhance its offerings and stay ahead of the competition.
1. **Integrated Ecosystem**: Square offers an integrated ecosystem of products and services that cover various aspects of running a business, including payment processing, point-of-sale systems, invoicing, payroll, and financial analytics. By providing a comprehensive suite of tools, Square offers added value to its customers and fosters loyalty by becoming a one-stop solution for their business needs.
1. **Data and Analytics**: Square collects valuable data on transactions, customer behavior, and sales trends through its platform. By analyzing this data, Square can provide actionable insights and recommendations to help businesses optimize their operations, improve sales, and identify growth opportunities. This data-driven approach gives Square a competitive edge in delivering personalized solutions and driving business growth for its customers.
1. **Brand Recognition and Trust**: Square has built a strong brand reputation for reliability, transparency, and customer service. Its recognizable brand and trusted reputation give it an advantage in attracting and retaining customers, as businesses feel confident in choosing Square for their payment processing and financial needs.

Overall, Square's unfair advantage lies in its ability to combine simplicity, innovation, integration, data analytics, and brand trust to offer compelling solutions that empower small businesses and individuals to thrive in the digital economy.


In the financial technology (fintech) and payment processing domain, Square competes with several major companies, each offering a range of products and services targeting similar customer segments. Some of the key competitors of Square include:

1. **PayPal**: PayPal is one of the largest and most well-known payment processing companies globally. It offers a wide range of services, including online payments, peer-to-peer transfers (through Venmo), merchant services, and business financing.
1. **Stripe**: Stripe is a technology company that provides payment processing software and APIs for online businesses. It specializes in helping businesses accept payments over the internet and offers tools for managing subscriptions, handling marketplace transactions, and more.
1. **Shopify**: While primarily known as an e-commerce platform, Shopify also offers its own payment processing solution called Shopify Payments. It allows merchants to accept credit card payments online and in-person through Shopify's point-of-sale system.
1. **Adyen**: Adyen is a global payment company that offers a unified payment platform for online, mobile, and in-store transactions. It provides a range of payment methods and features for businesses operating internationally.
1. **Square's Cash App**: While not a direct competitor to Square's core payment processing business, Square's Cash App competes in the peer-to-peer payments space with apps like Venmo (owned by PayPal) and Zelle (backed by several major U.S. banks).
1. **Worldpay**: Worldpay is a payment processing company that offers a variety of payment solutions for businesses, including in-store, online, and mobile payments. It provides services to merchants of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises.

These companies, along with others in the industry, compete with Square in various aspects of payment processing, financial services, and technology solutions. Each company may have its own strengths, focus areas, and target markets, contributing to a dynamic and competitive landscape in the fintech industry.


In the fintech and payment processing domain, companies typically use a variety of metrics to measure success and evaluate their performance. Some of the core metrics include:

1. **Total Payment Volume (TPV)**: TPV represents the total value of transactions processed through a company's payment processing platform. It is a key indicator of the company's market share and revenue generation.
1. **Revenue**: Revenue includes the total income generated from payment processing fees, subscription fees, transaction fees, and other sources. Increasing revenue indicates growth and market traction.
1. **Number of Active Merchants/Users**: The number of active merchants or users using the company's payment processing services is a measure of customer acquisition and retention. A growing user base indicates demand for the company's products and services.
1. **Transaction Volume**: Transaction volume measures the total number of transactions processed through the company's platform. Increasing transaction volume reflects growing usage and adoption of the company's services.
1. **Gross Payment Volume (GPV)**: GPV represents the total value of transactions processed through the company's platform before deducting fees. It is a measure of the company's scale and transaction throughput.
1. **Average Transaction Value (ATV)**: ATV calculates the average value of each transaction processed through the company's platform. Monitoring ATV helps identify trends in customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
1. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: NPS measures customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers how likely they are to recommend the company's services to others. A high NPS indicates strong customer satisfaction and positive word-of-mouth referrals.
1. **Customer Churn Rate**: Customer churn rate measures the percentage of customers who stop using the company's services over a specific period. Minimizing churn is important for maintaining a healthy customer base and sustaining growth.
1. **Profitability and Margins**: Profitability metrics, such as gross margin and operating margin, indicate the company's ability to generate profits from its operations and manage costs effectively.

As for Square's performance based on these metrics, I don't have access to real-time data. However, historically, Square has demonstrated strong growth in metrics like TPV, revenue, and active users. Its innovative products and services, coupled with its expanding ecosystem, have contributed to its success in the fintech industry. For the most up-to-date information on Square's performance, you can refer to its financial reports, earnings calls, and investor presentations.



If I were to advise Square on potential products or services to offer, I would consider several factors, including market demand, customer needs, and strategic alignment with Square's existing offerings and capabilities. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Business Banking Services**: Expanding into the realm of business banking could provide Square with an opportunity to offer a comprehensive suite of financial services to its small business customers. This could include business checking and savings accounts, business loans, lines of credit, and other banking products tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs and small businesses.
1. **Integrated Marketing Solutions**: Square could develop integrated marketing solutions to help small businesses attract and retain customers. This could include tools for email marketing, social media advertising, customer relationship management (CRM), and loyalty programs, all seamlessly integrated with Square's existing point-of-sale and payment processing platform.
1. **International Expansion and Global Payments**: Focusing on international expansion and offering solutions for global payments could help Square tap into new markets and serve businesses operating internationally. This could involve supporting multiple currencies, cross-border transactions, compliance with international regulations, and localization of products and services for specific regions.
